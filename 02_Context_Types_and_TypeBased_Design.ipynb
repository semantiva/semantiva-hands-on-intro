    "# Notebook 02: Context Types & Type-Based Design\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explore **Context Types** and the underlying principles of **Type-Based Design** in Semantiva. Building on the basics from Notebook 01, you will learn how typed contexts provide structured interfaces for data and operations, ensuring better maintainability and fewer runtime errors. Through hands-on examples, youâ€™ll discover how to define, manage, and leverage these context types effectively, setting a solid foundation for more advanced pipelines and workflows in upcoming notebooks.\n",
