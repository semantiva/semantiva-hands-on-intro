    "**Key points:**\n",
    "- Working with `DataCollection` objects\n",
    "- Viewing and interacting with image stacks in Jupyter\n",
    "- Adapting algorithms to process multiple images (e.g., background subtraction)\n",
    "- Extending pipelines to handle stacks\n",
    "- Using advanced probes (e.g., 2D Gaussian) across collections\n",

    "This notebook demonstrates how to handle multi-image workflows efficiently, an essential step for real-world image analysis tasks.\n",
